## Project for Advanced Java

This was an assignment in my high school Advanced Java class in September of 2022. It was a project that was meant as a
refresher into Android Studio. I chose to represent this in the form of showing amazing art that people had released
but was not being fully appreciated.

Requirements: 
1) 4 TextViews
2) 4 ImageViews
3) 2 Buttons
4) 2 Screens
5) LogCat output
6) Android Toast
